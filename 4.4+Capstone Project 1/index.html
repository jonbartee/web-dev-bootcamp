  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
  I’m an IT professional specializing in monitoring, observability, and systems reliability  <br/>
  with a proven track record of keeping critical business applications running smoothly in  <br/>
  complex enterprise environments. <br/>
  Over the past several years, I’ve advanced from hands-on  <br/>
  datacenter operations to supporting global cloud infrastructure, SaaS platforms, and corporate systems.
  </p>

  <p>
  Currently, I serve as a Monitoring and Observability Specialist at Gulfstream Aerospace, <br/>
  where I administer tools like Grafana, Prometheus, ManageEngine Applications Manager,  <br/>
  and OpManager to provide real-time visibility into infrastructure, applications, and networks. <br/>
  I design tailored dashboards, implement proactive alerting workflows, and leverage automation  <br/>
  with PowerShell, Bash, Python, and Azure DevOps to reduce downtime and manual workload.
  </p>

  <p> 
  My background includes building and maintaining bare-metal servers, supporting large-scale cloud deployments, <br/>
  integrating monitoring with SSO/SAML authentication, and collaborating across engineering, security, <br/>
  and support teams to deliver rapid incident resolution. <br/>
  I excel at translating business requirements <br/>
  into actionable system solutions while balancing performance needs with budget considerations.
  </p>

  <p> 
  I’m a proactive learner with a DevOps mindset, comfortable adapting to new technologies quickly, <br/>
  and committed to fostering collaboration, reducing technical debt, and improving operational efficiency.
